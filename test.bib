    , abstract = {CoO and Co3O4 have been studied by high-resolution X-ray photoemission. The characteristic binding energies in the Co 2p32, 2p12, and 3s regions, their band shapes and widths, the associated shake-up structure, the O(1s) and O(2s) BE's, and the valence band spectra have been examined. The two oxides are readily distinguished from their spectra though it is shown that the O(1s) BE's are identical at 529.50 ± 0.14 eV. Argon and oxygen ion sputtered surfaces were examined to establish the integrity of the oxides. A higher BE O(1s) component (530.7–531.6 eV), the intensity and BE of which vary with the treatments mentioned above, corresponds to non-stoichiometric surface oxygen. The results are discussed with respect to the electronic structures of the oxides and the often conflicting earlier studies of these oxides.}

    , abstract = {In the search for precious-metal-free electrode materials for electrochemical water splitting, transition-metal oxides have been receiving much recent interest as active and stable electrocatalysts for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We present operando surface X-ray diffraction studies of two structurally well-defined epitaxial cobalt oxide thin films: Co3O4(111) and CoOOH(001) electrodeposited on Au(111). The potential-dependent structural changes during cyclic voltammograms were monitored with high time resolution up to OER current densities as high as 150 mA cm–2. The CoOOH(001) film is found to be smooth and perfectly stable over a wide potential range. In the case of Co3O4(111), fast and fully reversible structural changes are observed. Specifically, the surface region of Co3O4(111) starts restructuring at potentials 300 mV negative of the onset of the OER, indicating that the process is related to the thermodynamically predicted Co3O4/CoOOH(001) transition rather than to the catalytic reaction. The formed skin layer is of defined thickness, which changes linearly with applied potential, and is the OER active phase. Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of the skin layer covered Co3O4 film and that of the smooth CoOOH(001) are almost identical, if the true microscopic surface area is taken into account. This indicates that the number of OER active sites on the two oxides is similar, despite the very different defect density, and is at variance with previous suggestions that di-μ-oxo bridged Co cations are exclusively responsible for the OER activity of Co oxides. For the smooth CoOOH(001), a turnover frequency of 4.2 s–1 per surface atom is determined at an overpotential of 400 mV. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that the pseudocapacitive charging current in the pre-OER potential range must be assigned to a bulk process that is accompanied by potential-dependent changes of the unit cell volume in the Co3O4 bulk.}

    , abstract = {Energy storage devices that efficiently use energy, in particular renewable energy, are being actively pursued. Aqueous redox supercapacitors, which operate in high ionic conductivity and environmentally friendly aqueous electrolytes, storing and releasing high amounts of charge with rapid response rate and long cycling life, are emerging as a solution for energy storage applications. At the core of these devices, electrode materials and their assembling into rational configurations are the main factors governing the charge storage properties of supercapacitors. Redox‐active metal compounds, particularly oxides and hydroxides that store charge via reversible valence change redox reactions with electrolyte ions, are prospective candidates to optimize the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. To address this target, collaborative investigations, addressing different streams, from fundamental charge storage mechanisms and electrode materials engineering to need‐tailored device assemblies, are the key. Over the last few years, significant achievements in metal oxide and hydroxide–based aqueous supercapacitors have been reported. This work discusses the most recent achievements and trends in this field and brings into the spotlight the authors' viewpoints.}

    , abstract = {Nanoscale metal oxides (NMOs) have found wide-scale applicability in a variety of environmental fields, particularly catalysis, gas sensing, and sorption. Facet engineering, or controlled exposure of a particular crystal plane, has been established as an advantageous approach to enabling enhanced functionality of NMOs. However, the underlying mechanisms that give rise to this improved performance are often not systematically examined, leading to an insufficient understanding of NMO facet reactivity. This critical review details the unique electronic and structural characteristics of commonly studied NMO facets and further correlates these characteristics to the principal mechanisms that govern performance in various catalytic, gas sensing, and contaminant removal applications. General trends of facet-dependent behavior are established for each of the NMO compositions, and selected case studies for extensions of facet-dependent behavior, such as mixed metals, mixed-metal oxides, and mixed facets, are discussed. Key conclusions about facet reactivity, confounding variables that tend to obfuscate them, and opportunities to deepen structure–property–function understanding are detailed to encourage rational, informed design of NMOs for the intended application.}

    , abstract = { Cobalt hydroxide, cobalt oxyhydroxide, and cobalt oxide nanomaterials were synthesized through simple soft chemistry. The cobalt hydroxide displays hexagonal morphology with clear edges 20 nm long. This morphology and nanosize is retained through to cobalt oxide Co3O4 through a topotactical relationship. Cobalt oxyhydroxide and cobalt oxide nanomaterials were synthesized through oxidation and low-temperature calcination from the as-prepared cobalt hydroxide. Characterization of these cobalt-based nanomaterials was fully developed, including X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy combined with selected area electron diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis. Bonding of the divalent cobalt hydroxide from the oxyhydroxide and oxides by studying their high-resolution XPS spectra for Co 2p3/2 and O 1s. Raman spectroscopy of the as-prepared Co(OH)2, CoO(OH), and Co3O4 nanomaterials characterized each material. The thermal stability of the materials Co(OH)2 and CoO(OH) was established. This research has developed methodology for the synthesis of cobalt oxide and cobalt oxyhydroxide nanodiscs at low temperatures. }
